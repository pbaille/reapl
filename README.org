#+title: Reapl

* Reapl, a reaper REPL

The goal of this project is to implement a reaper REPL that speaks lisp.

** Reaper

[[https://www.reaper.fm/][Reaper]] is an highly extensible DAW.
It is scriptable using the [[https://www.lua.org/][Lua language]].

** Fennel

[[https://fennel-lang.org/][Fennel]] is a lisp that compiles to lua.
Therefore it is the perfect tool for creating a lisp repl for reaper.

** Clojure

Those pieces will come together using the clojure language.
We will leverage the Clojure REPL workflow that is well supported in most editors.

** Setup

*** Prerequisites

- [[https://reapack.com/][reapack]]

*** Reaper

In reaper 7.x, go to Extensions > ReaPack > Import repositories...
